<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
<Section>
    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>Currently the features that I plan to include would be Bootstrap and Navbars. I am designing my site to be a more simple but clean site.</p>
    <h2>How am I using these features?</h2>
    <p>I am using bootstrap to both allow my site to be mobile responsive, but I also will be using its styling to give a solid foundation for the styling of the webpage. I will also be using Navbars, they will be used to link to all sections of my webpage.</p>
    <p>Currently I still plan to have some flexibility on the use of other features of bootstrap it help build forms and other features.</p>
